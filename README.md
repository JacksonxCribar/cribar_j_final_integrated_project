# Challenges
- I wasn't able to get the responsive aspect working which sucks (going to loose some marks for that), I think I messed up early and by the time 	I realized my mistake it was far too late (I admit defeat there, It just wasnt working the way it was meant to unfortunatly, spent a long time 		trying to get it working)

- Doing the JS took a lot of trial and error but eventually it worked out good

- I'm really happy with how the layout came out, I think it looks really professional and I am proud of it

- Overall I am very happy with how this project came out in the end (Minus the responsive aspect :( )

- I am really happy with how the CSS work came out, specifically the :hover aspects of the website, I think it really adds to it
